Accumulators:
=============
Mostly used as a global counter used for shared variable implementation in such a way that every task can update exactly once in its lifetime
if executed inside actions only even if tasks get re-executed.There is no guarantee inside transformations for the same.

1. Has an inherent support for int values.
2. User defined also supported via user defined classes. 
3. Update action happens when series of transformations leads to action.
4. User defined types should inherit AccumalatorParam class and overrides its 2 methods by name zero(self,initialSize) and addInPlace(self,s1,s2)

See.. accumulator_example.py for implementation details.
